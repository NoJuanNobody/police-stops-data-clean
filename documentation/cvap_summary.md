## Technical Methodology

### 📊 **Analysis Approach**

1. **Data Sources**:
   - CVAP: Census Bureau ACS 2019-2023
   - Police Stops: Historical department data

2. **Geographic Matching**:
   - Hillsborough County, Florida
   - Tampa Police Department + Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office

3. **Demographic Mapping**:
   - Police race categories → CVAP categories
   - Standardized comparison framework

4. **Disparity Calculation**:
   - Ratio = (Police Stops % / CVAP %)
   - >1.5x = Over-representation
   - <0.8x = Under-representation

### 🔍 **Statistical Notes**

- **Confidence Intervals**: CVAP data includes margins of error
- **Sample Size**: Large dataset (2.1M stops) provides statistical power
- **Rounding**: CVAP estimates are rounded per Census Bureau standards
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive police department coverage

## Conclusion

The CVAP analysis reveals **significant racial disparities** in police stops in Hillsborough County. Black residents are substantially over-represented, while Hispanic and Asian residents are under-represented. These findings suggest potential racial bias in policing practices and highlight the need for improved data collection and policy reforms.
