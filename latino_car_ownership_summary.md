## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Latino households have slightly different vehicle ownership patterns compared to non-Latino households. While Latino households are more likely to own multiple vehicles, they are also slightly more likely to have no vehicles at all. This suggests that transportation access varies within the Latino community, with some households having excellent vehicle access while others may face transportation challenges.

The findings highlight the importance of transportation policy that considers the diverse needs of Latino communities, including support for both public transportation and vehicle access programs.
